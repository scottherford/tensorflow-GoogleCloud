Option A: If you wish to run the code in the sections 3 to 14 on the Google Cloud Platform:

Use the rest of section 2 to get set up with a GCP account and Datalab (to run Jupyter notebooks on the cloud)
Option B: If you wish to run the code in the sections 3 to 14 on your local machine (and not on the GCP):

Please remove the following import statement import google.datalab.ml as ml  and all references to this library to run TensorBoard (that library is specific to the GCP)
In order to run TensorBoard switch over to your command line and run this command tensorboard --logdir=./<directory_name_here> --port 6006
