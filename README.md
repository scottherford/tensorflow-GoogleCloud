# tensorflow-GoogleCloud
TensorFlow is quickly becoming the technology of choice for deep learning, because of how easy TF makes it to build powerful and sophisticated neural networks. The Google Cloud Platform is a great place to run TF models at scale, and perform distributed training and prediction.

What's covered:

Deep learning basics: What a neuron is; how neural networks connect neurons to 'learn' complex functions; how TF makes it easy to build neural network models
Using Deep Learning for the famous ML problems: regression, classification, clustering and autoencoding
CNNs - Convolutional Neural Networks: Kernel functions, feature maps, CNNs v DNNs 
RNNs - Recurrent Neural Networks: LSTMs, Back-propagation through time and dealing with vanishing/exploding gradients
Unsupervised learning techniques - Autoencoding, K-means clustering, PCA as autoencoding 
Working with images
Working with documents and word embeddings
Google Cloud ML Engine: Distributed training and prediction of TF models on the cloud
Working with TensorFlow estimators

Learnings:

Build and execute machine learning models on TensorFlow
Implement Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks
Understand and implement unsupervised learning models such as Clustering and Autoencoders
